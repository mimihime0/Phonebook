# Phonebook Project 
This project aims to develop a phonebook program that handles contacts and events/appointemts. 

## Problem Statement 

You are tasked with developing a phonebook program, it must be implemented using either Linked Lists or Binary Search Trees. 
The program must allow users to add, delete, and search for contacts while also enabling the scheduling of events or appointments. 
It should prevent duplicate contacts by ensuring no existing contact shares the same full name or phone number. 
Additionally, the system must include conflict-checking mechanisms to avoid overlapping events. 
Users should be able to print contacts alphabetically by first name, print event details, and list all events in alphabetical order. 

## Project Structure: 

*The project was divided to two phases, this is the final one*

### First Phase: We used Linked Lists for the first version of the code, which was a simpler version.

### Second Phase: We used Binary Search Trees for the final version of the code for many reasons: 
**1. Faster search.**

**2. Ordered structure.**

**3. Prevents duplicates.**

**4. Better conflict checking.**
